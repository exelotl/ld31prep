A bunch of tools I collected in a hurry for Ludum Dare

My own stuff:

* class system (oo.lua)
* FPS Limiter (limitframerate.lua)
* index-preserving entity list (entitylist.lua)
* table serialisation, validation and parsing library (serial.lua, which additionally borrows some code from the lua-users wiki)
* a bunch of stuff from old projects that doesn't quite work yet (junk/)

Other people's stuff:

* HUMP camera/gamestate/signal - https://github.com/vrld/hump 
* flux tweening - library https://github.com/rxi/flux
